# AVL Tree Implementation

## Overview
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, which maintains its balance factor to optimize performance. Similar to a Binary Search Tree (BST), each node in an AVL tree has at most two child nodes: the left child and the right child. However, unlike a BST, an AVL tree ensures that the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one, ensuring a balanced structure.

## Operations
### Insertion
Inserting a new element into an AVL tree involves the same process as a BST, but with an additional step to balance the tree if necessary. After inserting the new node, the AVL tree checks the balance factor of each node and performs rotations as needed to maintain balance.

### Deletion
Deleting a node from an AVL tree follows a similar process to deletion in a BST, with additional rotations performed to rebalance the tree if necessary.

### Search
Searching for a specific value in an AVL tree follows the same process as a BST, utilizing the sorted nature of the tree to efficiently locate the target value.

## Advantages
- **Self-Balancing:** The key advantage of AVL trees over basic BSTs is their ability to automatically maintain balance, ensuring efficient performance for operations like search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Efficient Search:** AVL trees offer efficient search operations with a time complexity of O(log n) on average, making them suitable for applications requiring fast retrieval of data.
- **Dynamic Data Structure:** Like BSTs, AVL trees can dynamically adjust their structure as elements are inserted or deleted, providing flexibility for dynamic environments.

## Limitations
- **Complexity:** Implementing AVL trees requires additional logic for balancing, increasing the complexity of insertion and deletion operations compared to basic BSTs.
- **Overhead:** AVL trees may incur additional memory overhead due to the storage of balance factors and pointers for each node, impacting space efficiency.

## Conclusion
AVL trees are a powerful variant of binary search trees, offering automatic balance maintenance and efficient search operations. While they require additional overhead and complexity compared to basic BSTs, AVL trees provide an effective solution for applications requiring fast and reliable data retrieval.
